# Crowdfunding_ETL

On this ETL mini project, we  worked together to build an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files,
(Campaign.csv, Category.csv, Contacts.csv, Subcategory.csv) and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres and Filtered through each table.
